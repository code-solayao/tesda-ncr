                    Training Regulations (TR) â€“ a TESDA-promulgated document that serves as basis for which the competency-based curriculum and instructional materials 
                    and competency assessment tools are developed. This document represents a specific qualification. It defines the competency standards for 
                    a national qualification and how such qualification can be gained, assessed and be given recognition.
